/**
 * Data class representing the components extracted from a Snowflake ID.
 *
 * @property machineId The unique identifier of the machine or node that generated the Snowflake ID.
 *                     This is used to ensure uniqueness across different machines and is derived from
 *                     a specific portion of the Snowflake ID.
 * @property sequence A sequence number that increments with each ID generated within the same millisecond.
 *                    This is used to ensure uniqueness of IDs generated within the same millisecond.
 *                    If IDs are not generated at a frequency higher than one per millisecond, this value
 *                    will typically be 0.
 * @property utc The UTC timestamp representing the moment the ID was generated,
 *                        providing chronological ordering of IDs.
 * @property local Same as [utc], but converted to the local time zone.
