## Building and Executing a Fat JAR

The [Ktor Gradle plugin](https://ktor.io/docs/server-fatjar.html#build) allows to create and run an executable JAR that includes all code dependencies (fat JAR).

* **Building the fat JAR:** Employ the `buildFatJar` Gradle task provided by Ktor.

* To run the **fat JAR** locally, either execute the `runFatJar` Gradle task or use the command line.
  For the latter, open a terminal and navigate to the root `build/libs` directory, where the **fat JAR**
  is located. Execute the following command:

```
java.exe -jar krud-1.0.0-all.jar
```

### Testing the fat JAR:

Upon server startup, observe the console output. Once initialization is complete, you can test the server by
opening a web browser and navigating to any of the following URLs:

http://localhost:8080

http://localhost:8080/demo?page=0&size=24

http://localhost:8080/health

http://localhost:8080/rbac/login
