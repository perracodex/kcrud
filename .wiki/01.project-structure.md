## Project Structure

**Kcrud** is organized into a multi-project setup, where each component (_subproject_) serves a distinct role within
the overall server architecture:

1. [kcrud-server](../kcrud-server) is the primary project component, responsible for server initialization, and integration of all server components.
   It manages the server's lifecycle from startup to shut-down and serves as the backbone of the application's operations.

2. [kcrud-base](../kcrud-base) provides shared infrastructure and services, such as utility functions, server configurations, and database
   connection facilities. Designed to support operational needs of domain-specific components, promoting code reuse to shared concerns.

3. [kcrud-access](../kcrud-access) provides security and access control services, including authentication, authorization,
   and user management. It leverages the ```kcrud-base``` for shared functionalities.

4. [kcrud-employee](../kcrud-employee) is a specialized domain component dedicated to managing employee records, encompassing all CRUD operations.
   It leverages the ```kcrud-base``` component for shared functionalities, and ```kcrud-access``` for security and access control.

5. [kcrud-employment](../kcrud-employment) manages employment related data and logic, relying on ```kcrud-employee``` for accessing specific employee
   details, ```kcrud-base``` for shared services, and ```kcrud-access``` for security and access control.

### A note about startup times.

**Kcrud** server startup time can be optimized by disabling unnecessary features.
[Turn off](../kcrud-base/src/main/resources/config/config_api_schema.conf) documentation API schema generation.
Conduct database migrations in a controlled setting, not in production. Manage these settings via `hconf` configuration files.
