### Micrometer Metrics

Krud includes a basic example of [Micrometer Metrics](../krud-core/base/src/main/kotlin/krud/base/plugins/MicrometerMetrics.kt) with Prometheus integration.
Once the project starts, the console will display the endpoint exposing the metrics for monitoring.
Here's how to set up [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to collect and visualize those metrics.

#### Setting Up Prometheus

1. [Download](https://prometheus.io/download/) and install Prometheus.
2. Edit the existing `prometheus.yml` that comes with the installation and **append** the following job within ```scrape_configs```:
   ```yaml
     # Krud
     - job_name: "krud"
       scrape_interval: 5s # Adjust to your desired interval.
       static_configs:
          - targets: ["localhost:8080"] # Change to your server's address.
       metrics_path: "/metrics"
       scheme: "http" # Change to "https" if your server uses HTTPS.
       basic_auth:
          username: "admin" # Change to your username.
          password: "admin" # Change to your password.
   ```
3. Start Prometheus and navigate to [http://localhost:9090/targets](http://localhost:9090/targets) to verify that the
   `krud` job is up and running.
4. Navigate to [http://localhost:9090/graph](http://localhost:9090/graph) and enter `ktor_http_server_requests_seconds` in the `Expression` field to see request latency.

Prometheus is now ready. Perform a few Krud requests, for example using the infinite scroll endpoint example. You should get something like this:

#### Setting Up Grafana

1. [Download](https://grafana.com/grafana/download) and install Grafana.
2. Start Grafana and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to log in with the default credentials (admin/admin).
3. Add a new Prometheus data source by navigating to `Connnections` > `Data Sources` (http://localhost:3000/connections/datasources).
4. Select `Prometheus` and enter [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090) as the URL.
5. Add the Basic Auth credentials if you set them up in the `prometheus.yml` file. Leave the rest of the settings as default.
6. Click `Save & Test` to save the data source.
7. Navigate to `Dashboards` > `Create` and select `New` > `Import`. Enter `4701` as the Dashboard ID to import the pre-built Ktor dashboard.
8. Select the Prometheus data source and click `Import` to import the dashboard.
9. Navigate to the `Ktor` dashboard to view the metrics.

Grafana is now ready. You should get something like this:

You can create your own dashboards and add any desired metrics, for example `ktor_http_server_requests_seconds` to monitor request latency.
