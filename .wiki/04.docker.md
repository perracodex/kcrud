## Docker Containerization

Ensure Docker is [installed](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and operational in your local environment.

### Docker Advantages:

* Automated **fat JAR** creation using the provided [docker-full-build.Dockerfile](../docker-full-build.Dockerfile).
* Alternative  [docker-no-build.Dockerfile](../docker-no-build.Dockerfile) for scenarios preferring the use of a pre-built **fat JAR**.

### Building the Docker Image:

To construct the Docker image with the complete build process:

```
docker build -t krud-image -f ./docker-full-build.Dockerfile .
```

For using a pre-existing **fat JAR** (expected to be located in the build/libs directory):

```
docker build -t krud-image -f ./docker-no-build.Dockerfile .
```

### Using Docker Compose:

**Docker Compose** simplifies setup and deployment by automating service build and initialization, as specified
in the provided [docker-compose.yaml](../docker-compose.yaml), including port mapping and environment variable settings.

To deploy services with **Docker Compose** and ensure old unused containers are cleaned up:

```
docker-compose up --build --remove-orphans
```

To rebuild the Docker image and restart the container, use the `--build` flag:

``` 
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

_Note: The **--build** option forces the image to rebuild.
The **--remove-orphans** flag removes containers for services not defined in the Compose file._

### IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Integration:

For users of [IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate](https://www.jetbrains.com/products/compare/?product=idea&product=idea-ce), many of these Docker and Docker Compose commands can be run directly from the IDE,
which provides a convenient and integrated workflow for building images, starting services, and managing containers.

### Testing the Application:

After the container is running, observe the console output. Once initialization is complete, you can test the server by
opening a web browser and navigating to any of the following URLs:

http://localhost:8080

http://localhost:8080/demo?page=0&size=24

http://localhost:8080/health

http://localhost:8080/rbac/login
