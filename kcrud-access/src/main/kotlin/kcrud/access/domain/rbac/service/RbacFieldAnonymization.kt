/**
 * Utility class to anonymize fields based on their type.
 *
 * Enum types are not directly supported for anonymization due to the lack of a standardized approach.
 * A recommended practice is to include an `ANONYMIZED` value within all enum types to facilitate their anonymization.
 *
 * Lists are not supported, as for anonymization the list itself is replaced with an empty list,
 * and we cannot determine the original type of the list's elements. Another approach would
 * have been to anonymize the list's elements, but this would require a recursive approach to
 * anonymize nested lists.
 *
 * Special consideration must be given to the anonymization of time values.
 * The anonymization approach uses "00:00:00.000" as the placeholder for time values.
 * To distinguish between actual instances of midnight and anonymized values, we should consider implementing
 * an additional utility method that would adjust genuine "00:00:00.000" time values, whenever encountered,
 * to a slightly different time (e.g., "00:00:00.001") to prevent confusion with the anonymized time placeholder.
 * Another approach could be to just change Time fields to Text fields, and anonymize them as strings.
 *
